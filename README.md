# Products API

A simple RESTful API for some products.

## Get started

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/berxam/products-rest-api.git

# Move in to the directory
cd products-rest-api

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

Then you'll have to create a `.env` file, where you'll define the following fields:
```
MONGODB_URL=YOUR_MONGODB_APPLICATION_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE
PORT=YOUR_PORT_HERE
```

Then just run `npm start` to start the application. You can also use `npm run dev` when developing.
